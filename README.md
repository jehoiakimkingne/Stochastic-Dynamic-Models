# Stochastic-Dynamic-Models
Kalman Filtering and Numerical handling of Stochastic Differential Equations (like Black-Scholes or Cox-Ingersoll-Ross)

- On one hand, this project deals with Kalman Filtering and Smoothing to provide a good estimate of the state of a dynamic system. We also provide an implementation of a particle filtering method using boostrap particle filter in order to estimate the state of a dynamic system.

- On the other hand, we implemented some numerical methods like Euler, Millstein and Runge-Kutta (with order 1.5) to provide numerical solutions to stochastic differential equations like the Black-Scholes equation. We also tried to estimate the parameter of a stochastic differential equation using maximum-likelihood and non-parametric kernel methods.
